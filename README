This is an unofficial fork of Openstack/Folsom Quantum.

The following are two main features added by EIG/Bluehost.

1. New REST API: get_instance_nw_infos()

In order to run this new API, you need to have other BH-Enhanced packages
(e.g., BH-enhanced python-quantumclient and nova) that understand the new API.

2. You need to add 'BH_ovs_flows = True' in [Agent] in 'ovs_quantum_plugin.ini.'

[AGENT]
BH_ovs_flows = True

This design enables to pass through phy-br-eth0 where
reverting back packets for all intra-traffic among instances
within the same host. No tag on tap interfaces (i.e., tag:0).
